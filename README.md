# condrv_bsod_poc

This is a poc for Win10 bsod by visiting `\\.\globalroot\device\condrv\kernelconnect` because of condrv.sys.

The poc is a lnk file, I set the icon path to `\\.\globalroot\device\condrv\kernelconnect`, it can bsod when explorer extract the icon.

**So, if you unzip the zip file, your pc will bsod.**

Take care!

It's just for technology. Don't do bad things.
